# Dezrez Core API
##Who are we?
Dezrez is an independent software vendor based in Wales, UK.  We develop software for the property industry, and at the heart of all of our latest product offerings is the Dezrez Core API.

##What is the Dezrez Core API?
The Dezrez Core API is the backbone to all of our latest product offerings, and is a programmatic interface to all operations that can be performed across all of these products.

It is based on JSON, and is secured using OAuth2.

##API Environments
We have two environments for use by third parties - the first is the UAT environment, where clients are tested.  Then, there is our LIVE production environment.

Both of these environments have Swagger documents available, as well as having Swagger UI available.
However, you will not be able to make calls using Swagger UI on the production environment.

The URL for UAT is:
https://core-api-uat.dezrez.com/swagger/ui/index

And for LIVE:
https://api.dezrez.com/swagger/ui/index

##Learning resources
To help you understand how to use our API, we have compiled several resources that aim to bring you up to speed on what you need to know, quickly.
