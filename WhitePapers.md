# Dezrez Core API whitepapers
In order to demostrate the power of the Dezrez Core API, we are working on a collection of white papers that explain the benefits of having an API by investigation or implementing technical solutions to real or modelled business problems.

## White Paper - Dezrez Core Platform and Bots
We applied the microsoft bot framework to the Dezrez Core API, and came up with an appointment booker bot - can book viewings, valuations and financial appointments with appropriate staff with full free-busy and skills knowledge.
